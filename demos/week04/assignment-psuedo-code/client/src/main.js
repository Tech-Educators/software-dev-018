// create the form on the HTML page
// get the form as a DOM node

// write a function that makes a fetch to GET the messages
// make a request to our server
// put the results onto the page

// write a function that POSTS a new message when the form is submitted
// on submit, get the values from the form
// and INSERT them into the database
// MAYBE we could also rerun the function that GETs info, so it appears on the screen right away... maybe we could.
